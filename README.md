# Statistical_Inference
Coursera Project

The project consists of two parts:

A simulation exercise.
Basic inferential data analysis.
You will create a report to answer the questions. Given the nature of the series, ideally you'll use knitr to create the reports and convert to a pdf. (I will post a very simple introduction to knitr). However, feel free to use whatever software that you would like to create your pdf.

Each pdf report should be no more than 3 pages with 3 pages of supporting appendix material if needed (code, figures, etcetera).
